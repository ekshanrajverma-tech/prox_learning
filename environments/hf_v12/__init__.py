        "Four-object household plus standing kitchen extras attached by the "
        "preview renderer. Not pact_place_corridor_v12, which has no published "
        "dataset. Collected against molmospaces ed045d7; the pinned commit is a "
        "descendant. Every class this environment resolves — the policy, its "
        "config, and the whole sampler MRO — is byte-identical across the two, "
        "except PactPlaceCorridorV5Sampler and PactPlaceCorridorV9Sampler. "
        "Neither of those changes reaches this environment: V9 moves a literal "
        "height bound into VESSEL_HEIGHT_RANGE_M with the same (0.15, 0.25), "
        "and V5.add_auxiliary_objects gains an `if primitive:` branch for the "
        "V10.11b/c primitive clutter, leaving the mesh path this environment "
        "takes verbatim in the else. "
        "The scene is vendored under custom_scenes/ rather than read from the "
        "submodule, where it was never committed; the bytes, and so the "
        "recorded sha256, are unchanged."
